# Unit Testing Project in Python

This is a basic project to demonstrate the use of unit testing in Python using the `unittest` module. The code implements a simple function to calculate the average of a list of numbers and includes tests to verify that the function is working correctly.

## Project Structure
```
unit_test_project/
├── main.py
└── tests/
├── test_calculadora.py
```
- **main.py:** Contains the implementation of the `calcular_media` function.
- **tests/test_calculadora.py:** Contains the unit tests for the `calcular_media` function.

## Running the Tests

Make sure you are in the project root directory and run the following command in the terminal:

```
python -m unittest tests.test_calculadora
```

This will run the unit tests and provide feedback on whether the function is working as expected.
